# Insect Swarm Simulation

This repository contains a simulation of an insect swarm using the Boid algorithm. The simulation uses the p5.js library to visualize a swarm of insects that interact with each other and move according to basic flocking behaviors like alignment, cohesion, and separation.

## Features

- Simulates a swarm of insects with individual behaviors.
- The insects follow basic Boid rules: **alignment**, **cohesion**, and **separation**.
- The behavior of the insects is erratic, simulating quick adjustments like those of flying insects.
- The canvas is dynamic, and the swarm adapts to the movement and proximity of other insects.
  
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A web browser to run the simulation (no installation required).
- Internet access to load the p5.js library.

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/insect-swarm-simulation.git

2. Open the index.html file in your web browser to see the simulation.
